He is also a composer and arranger of music in a variety of genres. Julian has recorded for various independent labels and appears in notable jazz venues in Québec such as Upstairs Jazz Bar, Diese Onze in Montreal, and Bar Ste-Angèle in Québec City.

        A native of Trumbull, Connecticut, Julian’s musical studies began with piano lessons at age four. The following year, he started cello. He played both instruments equally throughout his childhood and won multiple awards and competitions on both. During his high school years, he switched from classical piano to jazz and subsequently graduated from the Schulich School of Music at McGill University in Montreal as a double major in cello and jazz piano performance.
